## 📢 News
- (Sep 5, 2025): We have moved the full dataset to HuggingFace to make it easier to download. Please refer to [data_generation](data_generation) for full instructions.

## 📋 Before You Start...
Depending on what you're interested in:

- 🚀 **If you want to download pretrained checkpoints and run the demo**: you can continue reading below.

- 🛠️ **If you want to access or generate the dataset yourself**: please refer to [data_generation](data_generation) for full instructions.

## Installation

Below are the setup instructions (mostly following [MASt3R repo](https://github.com/naver/mast3r)). We follow the MASt3R setup since it encapsulates DUSt3R, but both should work similarly.


1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/kvuong2711/aerial-megadepth.git
cd aerial-megadepth/mast3r

# If you already cloned the repository, you can update the submodules:
# git submodule update --init --recursive
```
2. Create environment and install dependencies:
```bash
conda create -n aerialmd python=3.11 cmake=3.14.0
conda activate aerialmd 
conda install pytorch torchvision pytorch-cuda=12.1 -c pytorch -c nvidia  # use the correct version of cuda for your system
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -r dust3r/requirements.txt
pip install -r dust3r/requirements_optional.txt
```
3. Optional, compile the cuda kernels for RoPE (as in CroCo v2):
```bash
# DUST3R relies on RoPE positional embeddings for which you can compile some cuda kernels for faster runtime.
cd dust3r/croco/models/curope/
python setup.py build_ext --inplace
cd ../../../../
```

## Quick Start
Our finetuned checkpoints are fully compatible with the original DUSt3R/MASt3R/MASt3R-SfM codebase - if you already have them set up, you can simply swap the checkpoint for aerial-ground scenarios!

### Checkpoints

There are two options for downloading DUSt3R and MASt3R checkpoint finetuned on our AerialMegaDepth dataset:

1. You can use our huggingface_hub integration: the models ([aerial-dust3r](https://huggingface.co/kvuong2711/checkpoint-aerial-dust3r) or [aerial-mast3r](https://huggingface.co/kvuong2711/checkpoint-aerial-mast3r)) will be downloaded automatically.

2. Or, download the checkpoints manually (using [gdown](https://github.com/wkentaro/gdown), install using `pip install gdown`):

```bash
# you are inside aerial-megadepth/mast3r
mkdir -p checkpoints/
gdown --fuzzy "https://drive.google.com/open?id=1wSGpYwWeGn99J8dVWNkfefwmWMAH7LFT" -O checkpoints/  # checkpoint-aerial-dust3r.pth
gdown --fuzzy "https://drive.google.com/open?id=1LrRNUQRQZcVzcioyYHYYx9ImypSZpUq2" -O checkpoints/  # checkpoint-aerial-mast3r.pth
```

### Inference/Demo
We provide a few example images in the [assets](assets) folder for quick testing, including images from [ULTRRA challenge](https://sites.google.com/view/ultrra-wacv-2025) and [Accenture-NVS1](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.18711).

Each script (e.g., [demo_dust3r_nongradio.py](mast3r/demo_dust3r_nongradio.py)) contains predefined image paths to demonstrate typical use cases. You can modify the `image_list` variable inside the script to try different pairs. You can run inference using the following commands:

- DUSt3R demo code:
```bash
python demo_dust3r_nongradio.py --weights kvuong2711/checkpoint-aerial-dust3r

# or, if you downloaded the checkpoints manually:
# python demo_dust3r_nongradio.py --weights checkpoints/checkpoint-aerial-dust3r.pth
```

- MASt3R demo code:
```bash
python demo_mast3r_nongradio.py --weights kvuong2711/checkpoint-aerial-mast3r

# or, if you downloaded the checkpoints manually:
# python demo_mast3r_nongradio.py --weights checkpoints/checkpoint-aerial-mast3r.pth
```

## Evaluation

- [ ] **TODO:** Evaluation data will be released soon.

Once data is downloaded, run the evaluation script:
```bash
python eval.py \
    --weights checkpoints/checkpoint-aerial-dust3r.pth \
    --eval_data_dir data/eval_data_release
```
This script (adapted from [PoseDiffusion](https://github.com/facebookresearch/PoseDiffusion)) reports RRA and RTA at various degree thresholds.
